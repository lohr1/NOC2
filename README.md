# NOC2

This is the final code of an optional project (worth 3 ECTS) completed for the course Numerical Optimal Control with Prof. Moritz Diehl during SS23 at the University of Freiburg.

The project report may be found in the file: 'NOC_Report.pdf'

The grade given for this project was a 1.3. Due to examination regulations, this grade only appears on my transcript as a passing grade ("BE" for Bestanden).

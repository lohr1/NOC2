# NOC2

This is the final code of an optional project (worth 3 ECTS) completed for the course Numerical Optimal Control with Prof. Moritz Diehl during SS23 at the University of Freiburg.

Grade: 1.3. 
Due to examination regulations, however, this grade only appears on my transcript as "BE" for Bestanden.

The project report may be found in the file: 'NOC_Report.pdf'
